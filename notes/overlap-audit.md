# Overlap audit (stub)

Goal: ensure conceptual continuity without verbatim reuse across:
- AI & Society paper (this repo)
- IJPM Machine Folie à Deux paper
- Synthese philosophy paper

## High-risk overlap zones
1) “Ethics as stability condition” definitions
2) Folie à deux framing paragraphs
3) Any clinical vignettes (must appear only in IJPM)

Record any reused sentences here and rephrase or cite appropriately.
