2. Asymmetric Cognitive Amplification

Artificial intelligence systems increasingly function as general-purpose cognitive amplifiers, enhancing human abilities to generate plans, explore counterfactuals, construct narratives, and coordinate action at scale. While such amplification is often framed as uniformly beneficial, this section argues that its risks arise from asymmetry: the selective strengthening of some cognitive functions without a corresponding strengthening of the constraints that normally regulate their use.

2.1 Defining asymmetric cognitive amplification

By asymmetric cognitive amplification, this paper refers to situations in which an artificial intelligence system disproportionately enhances specific dimensions of cognition—such as speed, scope, internal coherence, or persuasiveness—while leaving other dimensions—such as ethical integration, epistemic humility, and long-horizon consequence tracking—largely unchanged or externally managed. The asymmetry is not merely quantitative but structural: amplified capacities operate with reduced coupling to the mechanisms that ordinarily stabilise human decision-making across time and social context.

Two clarifications are important. First, asymmetry does not imply absence: users retain ethical beliefs, social awareness, and uncertainty sensitivity. Rather, these elements become less influential in action selection once amplified processes dominate the cognitive landscape. Second, the risk does not require adversarial design. Well-intentioned systems optimised for helpfulness, efficiency, or user satisfaction can produce the same asymmetry when constraint is treated as an external consideration rather than a constitutive feature of cognition itself.

2.2 Historical analogy and its limits

Human cognitive history provides many examples of augmentation without catastrophe. Writing extended memory beyond the brain; mathematics enabled abstraction beyond intuition; bureaucratic systems coordinated action beyond face-to-face trust. However, these tools evolved within dense webs of constraint: cultural norms, professional ethics, legal accountability, and gradual institutional adaptation. Crucially, the pace of augmentation was often slow relative to the development of compensatory controls.

Artificial intelligence differs in three respects. First, it operates at digital speed, allowing rapid iteration and escalation. Second, it is highly general, affecting planning, persuasion, and sense-making simultaneously. Third, it is increasingly personalised, shaping individual cognitive environments rather than merely collective ones. In addition, contemporary systems increasingly integrate multiple cognitive functions within unified internal representations, intensifying amplification while leaving stabilising constraints externally imposed. Together, these features make traditional, after-the-fact constraints less effective at maintaining proportionality between capacity and responsibility.

2.3 A taxonomy of amplification-related risks

Asymmetric cognitive amplification manifests through several recurring mechanisms.

2.3.1 Planning amplification. Artificial intelligence systems can dramatically increase the depth, breadth, and adaptiveness of planning. While valuable, this capacity becomes hazardous when decoupled from proportional consequence evaluation and long-horizon responsibility (Amodei et al. 2016).

2.3.2 Persuasion amplification. Language-capable systems can enhance persuasive power by tailoring messages to specific audiences, emotional states, or social contexts, including inward persuasion through self-justification and narrative consolidation (Bender et al. 2021; Weidinger et al. 2022).

2.3.3 Scale amplification. Automation enables actions to be repeated and parallelised; weakly constrained strategies therefore propagate rapidly and widely, magnifying the impact of local errors or ethically thin decisions.

2.3.4 Justification amplification. Systems can supply reasons and rationalisations for a wide range of actions, reducing the psychological cost of acting on existing motivations and weakening the role of ethical hesitation and doubt (Mittelstadt et al. 2016).

2.4 Why ordinary users are sufficient

Because these mechanisms act on general features of human cognition—goal pursuit, narrative construction, and social reasoning—no unusual intent or disposition is required. Artificial intelligence systems that remove stabilising constraints on action selection can tip ordinary decision-making into regimes of ethical brittleness, even when users perceive themselves as acting responsibly.

2.5 Risk reframed as constraint failure

Many artificial intelligence risks are better understood as constraint failures than as failures of intelligence, alignment, or intent. This reframing motivates the need to couple amplified capacity to stabilising constraints within the cognitive process itself, rather than relying exclusively on external governance or post hoc correction.
