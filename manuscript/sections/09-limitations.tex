This paper is theoretical and synthetic rather than empirical. The phenomena discussed are difficult to operationalise and often unfold over time and within relational systems.

This paper does not evaluate REE as an implemented system; its role here is illustrative, demonstrating that ethical stability can be internalised architecturally rather than imposed externally

Psychiatric concepts are used functionally rather than diagnostically, and future work should clarify boundaries between transient effects and clinically significant psychopathology.

Constraint-based architectures raise implementation challenges (representing long-horizon coherence, integrating self–other modelling, balancing uncertainty retention with decisiveness) and require empirical evaluation.

Future directions include longitudinal human–machine interaction studies, experimental comparisons of assistant-style versus constraint-based systems, and clinical research on artificial intelligence use as a contributing factor in cognitive destabilisation.
