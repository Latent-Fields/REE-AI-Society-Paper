Many risks associated with artificial intelligence arise from asymmetric cognitive amplification rather than autonomy. Meaningful containment requires internal cognitive constraint as well as external governance.

\subsection*{Limits of control-based safety}
Output restrictions and policies are necessary but cannot reliably address subtle, cumulative harms such as epistemic override and narrative lock-in.

\subsection*{Constraint as design principle}
Containment through constraint structures cognition such that harmful trajectories fail to remain viable. This couples capability to the conditions required for sustainable action.

\subsection*{Architectural containment versus behavioural compliance}
In constraint-based systems, ethical stability is a prerequisite for effective selection rather than a boundary rule layered onto a generative core.
