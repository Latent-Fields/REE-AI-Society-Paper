# REE — AI & Society Paper

This repository contains the manuscript and supporting materials for:

**“Asymmetric Cognitive Amplification and Ethical Instability in Artificial Intelligence”**  
Target journal: *AI & Society* (Springer) which has been rejected based on AI being used to help support writing the manuscript.

It is part of the broader **Reflective–Ethical Engine (REE)** research programme.

## What’s inside

- `manuscript/` — LaTeX source split by sections (easy to edit/review)
- `references/` — BibTeX file and a living reading list
- `figures/` — diagrams (SVG preferred for clean scaling)
- `journal/` — submission notes, cover letter draft, and checklist
- `notes/` — overlap audit, reviewer-risk notes, future work

## Quick start

1. Write/update each section in `manuscript/sections/`.
2. Maintain citations in `references/references.bib`.
3. Generate figures in `figures/`.
4. Keep journal-facing admin in `journal/`.

## Suggested workflow

- Track tasks via GitHub Issues (see `notes/issues-seed.md` for ready-to-copy issue templates).
- Avoid verbatim reuse across related papers; log overlap decisions in `notes/overlap-audit.md`.

## License

Recommended: **CC-BY 4.0** for the manuscript text (update as desired).
