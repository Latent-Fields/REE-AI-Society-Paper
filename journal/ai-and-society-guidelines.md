Here’s what I was able to confirm from the official journal and publisher guidance for AI & Society (Springer Science+Business Media) — both submission requirements and policy on the use of generative artificial intelligence tools.

AI & Society — Submission Notes (with exact guideline excerpts)

1. Word Limits and Article Types

From the AI & Society submission guidelines hosted on Springer’s site:
	•	Research Section papers (standard submissions):
	•	Normal word length: 10 000 words.
	•	Maximum of four co-authors typical.  ￼
	•	Open Forum Section:
	•	Normal word length: 8 000 words.  ￼
	•	Review articles:
	•	Broadly variable, typically 1 000–8 000 words depending on the type or scope.  ￼
	•	Short formats (e.g., Curmudgeon Corner, News Item):
	•	~1 000 words or fewer.  ￼

Note: These are guidelines rather than rigid limits — actual editorial expectations may vary by article type and special issue.  ￼

2. Formatting Requirements

From the same submission page:
	•	Manuscripts must be submitted in Word (.docx or .doc) format.  ￼
	•	Headings: Follow a standard decimal system with no more than three levels.  ￼
	•	Abstract:
	•	Required and should be 150–250 words in general.
	•	For some articles (e.g., systematic reviews), this may be extended (up to ~450 words) when justified by reporting needs.  ￼
	•	Keywords: Provide 4–6 keywords for indexing.  ￼
	•	Footnotes and abbreviations:
	•	Footnotes are permitted with guidelines; abbreviations should be defined on first use.  ￼
	•	Figures & tables: Must be numbered and cited properly; follow Springer’s general artwork guidelines.  ￼
	•	Supplementary materials: Acceptable (.pdf, .xlsx, .csv, etc.) and should be cited in the manuscript.  ￼

3. Reference Style

AI & Society uses a name–year (author–year) citation system:

Cite references in the text by name and year in parentheses (e.g., Smith 2020).
Reference list entries should be alphabetised by the first author’s last name.  ￼

Springer’s guidelines suggest including DOIs as full DOI links where available.  ￼

Example citation style:

Smith J, Jones M (1999). Title of the article. Journal Name 12(3):45–67. https://doi.org/XXXXXX
```  [oai_citation:14‡SpringerLink](https://link.springer.com/journal/146/submission-guidelines)

## **4. Double-Blind Peer Review / Anonymity**

*AI & Society* uses **double-blind peer review**, meaning:

- The manuscript itself should be anonymised.
- Author names, affiliations, acknowledgements, and identifying information **should not appear in the main text**.  
- A separate title page (uploaded as a separate file) must contain author details, affiliations, and contact information.  [oai_citation:15‡SpringerLink](https://link.springer.com/journal/146/submission-guidelines)

## **5. Use of Generative AI Tools — Publisher Policy**

While *AI & Society* does not yet have a journal-specific policy publicly on its own pages, the **Taylor & Francis generative artificial intelligence policy** applies to its journals (and Springer’s policy is also relevant where applicable):

### **Taylor & Francis Generative AI Policy**

- **AI tools must not be listed as authors.**  [oai_citation:16‡Taylor & Francis](https://taylorandfrancis.com/our-policies/ai-policy/)

- **If generative AI tools are used**, authors must clearly **acknowledge in the article**:
  - Full name of the tool used,
  - Version number,
  - How it was used,
  - Reason for the use.  
  This statement should be placed in **Methods or Acknowledgments**.  [oai_citation:17‡Taylor & Francis](https://taylorandfrancis.com/our-policies/ai-policy/)

- Permitted uses include:
  - **Idea generation and exploration,**  
  - **Language improvement,**  
  - **Interactive search,**  
  - **Literature classification,**  
  - **Coding assistance.**  [oai_citation:18‡Taylor & Francis](https://taylorandfrancis.com/our-policies/ai-policy/)

- **Disallowed uses include** replacing core researcher responsibilities, such as:
  - Generating content *without human oversight*,
  - Creating/manipulating images or figures,
  - Synthetic data generation without rigorous methodology.  [oai_citation:19‡Taylor & Francis](https://taylorandfrancis.com/our-policies/ai-policy/)

- Editors and reviewers also **must not upload unpublished manuscripts into generative AI tools** during review.  [oai_citation:20‡Taylor & Francis](https://taylorandfrancis.com/our-policies/ai-policy/)

> These policies currently evolve and *AI & Society* authors are advised to check with the editorial contact before submission.  [oai_citation:21‡Taylor & Francis](https://taylorandfrancis.com/our-policies/ai-policy/)

## **6. Title Page and Declarations**

According to the Springer submission info:

- A separate title page should include:
  - Title, author names, affiliations,
  - Corresponding author contact,
  - ORCID identifiers (optional but recommended),
  - Acknowledgments and disclosures.  [oai_citation:22‡SpringerLink](https://link.springer.com/journal/146/submission-guidelines)

- **Declarations and statements** (e.g., funding, competing interests) may be added under separate sections, submitted via the interface.  [oai_citation:23‡SpringerLink](https://link.springer.com/journal/146/submission-guidelines)

---

## **7. Cover Letter Preparation (Stub)**

When preparing a **cover letter for *AI & Society***, include the following:

- Brief summary of the paper’s main contribution,
- Article type (e.g., Research),
- Word count (excluding references),
- Confirmation of double-blind compliant submission (authors anonymised),
- Disclosure of any generative AI tools used,
- Confirmation that the submission is original and not under consideration elsewhere,
- Corresponding author contact details.
