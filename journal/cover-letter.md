# Cover letter draft (AI & Society)

Dear Editor,

Please consider our manuscript, “Asymmetric Cognitive Amplification: Constraint Failure and Ethical Stability in Human–Machine Cognition,” for publication as an Original Article in AI & Society.

The manuscript advances a theoretical, interdisciplinary account of artificial intelligence risk that complements autonomy- and alignment-centred framings by analysing contemporary systems as cognitive amplifiers embedded within human decision-making. It argues that a significant, underexamined class of risks arises from asymmetric cognitive amplification: selectively strengthening planning, coherence, and decisiveness without commensurate strengthening of the ethical and epistemic constraints that stabilise cognition over time.

The paper makes three contributions aligned with AI & Society’s scope:

It reframes key artificial intelligence risks as constraint failures in human–machine cognition, explaining how epistemic override, narrative lock-in, reinforcement loops, and agency capture may emerge through ordinary, well-intentioned use rather than malicious intent or explicit misalignment.

It advances a constraint-based conception of ethics, treating ethical stability as a viability condition for cognition under irreducible uncertainty rather than as an externally imposed rule set or value specification.

It draws on interactional analysis and structurally grounded psychiatric parallels to characterise failure modes that can arise when amplified coherence operates without internal stabilising constraints.

To clarify architectural implications, the manuscript introduces the Reflective–Ethical Engine (REE) as an illustrative model of constraint-based cognition. REE is not presented as an implemented or empirically validated system, but as a conceptual demonstration that ethical and epistemic stability can, in principle, be internalised within cognitive architecture rather than imposed solely through governance or behavioural controls.

Use of artificial intelligence tools: Conversational artificial intelligence tools were used as a writing and editing aid (e.g., for structural refinement, stylistic clarity, and citation suggestions). No artificial intelligence system was used to generate empirical results, analyse original data, or determine the manuscript’s substantive claims. The author reviewed, revised, and approved the final text and takes full responsibility for the manuscript.

This manuscript has not been published elsewhere and is not under consideration by another journal.

Thank you for your consideration.

Yours sincerely,
