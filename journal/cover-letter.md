# Cover letter draft (AI & Society)

Dear Editor,

Please consider our manuscript entitled “Asymmetric Cognitive Amplification and Ethical Instability in Artificial Intelligence” for publication in *AI & Society*.

[1–2 paragraphs: novelty, why AI & Society, why now, and what readers gain.]

We confirm that the manuscript is original, not under consideration elsewhere, and that all authors approve submission.

Sincerely,
Daniel De La Harpe Golden
